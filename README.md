Tic-Tac-Toe, also referred to as Noughts and Crosses or Twiddles and Bears by others, is a short and 
simple game has been a staple in most homes for many years.

The goal is for participants to arrange their three permitted markings (Xs or Os), either vertically, horizontally, or 
diagonally, in a continuous line.

The rules state that each player selects a mark and places it on the grid in turn. When a player receives a continuous 
line of 3 or the 9-square grid is filled, the game is done.

The goal of the game is to create a continuous line of three cells. Players take turns placing their marks.
